A couple of projects I worked on recently. Tags: Football, Health Data Analysis

1) Comparing the on-field statistics of 3 footballers: Houssem Aouar of Lyon, Thomas Partey of Atletico Madrid and Granit Xhaka of Arsenal
   in Attack and Defence over seasons 2018/19 and 2019/20 and their mean stats over these 2 seasons.
   
   The project is written in python and uses libraries like pandas and matplotib.
   
   The data was taken from https://fbref.com/en/
   Aouar: https://fbref.com/en/players/a5db0bec/Houssem-Aouar
   Partey: https://fbref.com/en/players/529f49ab/Thomas-Partey
   Xhaka: https://fbref.com/en/players/e61b8aee/Granit-Xhaka
   Check repository for the data file.
   
   Arsenal Football Club are thought to be looking for a solid central midfielder, one primarily adept at protecting the defence and 
   capable of assisting in progressing forwards. 
   Thomas Partey and Houssem Aouar are said to be their prime transfer targets.
   The project compares the above 2 players stats to Arsenal's first choice central midfielder Granit Xhaka's.
   
   Note: Statistics like goals, assists, xG, xA have not been considered as they aren't a proper reflection of the qualities required for 
   a player to play the required role.
   
2) Comparing disease awareness levels and clinical factors between urban and rural populations.

   The project is written in python and uses libraries like pandas, scipy and matplotib.

   The synthetic dataset used was generated in consultation with experienced health professionals.
   
   The project compares disease awareness levels and clinical factors between urban and rural populations by calculating
   the number of patients and percentage of patients in each category for each parameter between the urban and rural datasets, and plotting these numbers
   in the form bar plot.
   The project also calculates whether occurence of the parameter is dependent on wheter the patient is urban or rural using Chi Square Test with
   threshold p-value 0.05.
